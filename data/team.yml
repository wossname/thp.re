  bio: |
    I've been developing web applications with the Ruby on Rails
    framework for over a decade now (something that not many people can
    claim!). Prior to that, I was building web apps in Python, and
    before that I was building embedded C++ code for Voice over IP
    gateways.

    In addition to Ruby, I've got a fair chunk of experience with
    JavaScript, and with managing the platforms we deploy apps onto
    (the cool kids call this bit DevOps). I've got a BEng (Hons) in
    Software Engineering from the University of Edinburgh and an AAT
    Diploma in Accounting (don't ask).

    When I'm not in the office, staring at a sea of code, I really
    enjoy a spot of indoor rock climbing. You can often find me hanging
    around the local climbing wall, trying to conquer my latest
    project!
